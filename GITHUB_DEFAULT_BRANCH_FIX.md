# 🔧 GitHub Default Branch Manual Fix Required

## 🎯 Action Needed

GitHub still shows `master` as the default branch instead of `main`. This requires manual intervention in GitHub Settings.

## 📋 Steps to Fix

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/DanielWarg/Alice/settings
   
2. **Change Default Branch**:
   - Scroll to "General" → "Default branch"
   - Currently shows: `master`
   - Change to: `main`
   - Click "Update" and confirm

3. **Delete Master Branch** (after default change):
   - Go to "Branches" tab
   - Find `master` branch
   - Click delete button (🗑️)
   - Confirm deletion

## ✅ Expected Result

- Default branch: `main` 
- Only one branch: `main`
- Clean repository structure

## 🚀 Why This Matters

- **Professional setup**: Single main branch workflow
- **CI/CD alignment**: All workflows target main branch
- **Contributor clarity**: No confusion about which branch to use
- **Branch protection**: Protection rules apply to main only

## 🔒 Security Note

This is part of Category 1 (Repo & Branching) requirements:
- [x] Default branch = main (master deprecated) - **NEEDS MANUAL GITHUB SETTING**
- [x] Branch protection on main
- [x] CODEOWNERS integration
