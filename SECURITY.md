# 🔒 Security Policy

Alice AI Assistant takes security seriously. As a privacy-first Swedish AI platform that processes voice data and integrates with personal services like Google Calendar and Gmail, we prioritize the security and privacy of our users and contributors.

## 🛡️ Security Philosophy

Alice is built on the principle of **"Privacy by Design"** with these core security tenets:

- **🏠 Local-First Processing**: All AI processing happens locally, minimizing data exposure
- **🔒 Zero Data Collection**: We never collect, store, or transmit user data to external servers
- **🇪🇺 GDPR Compliance**: Built to exceed European privacy standards
- **🔍 Transparent Architecture**: Open source codebase allows security auditing
- **⚡ Secure by Default**: Security features enabled out-of-the-box

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

**🔧 Development Security**
```bash
# Use secure development practices
pip install safety bandit  # Python security scanning
npm audit                  # Node.js vulnerability scanning
pre-commit install         # Automated security checks

# Regular dependency updates
pip-audit                  # Check Python dependencies
npm audit fix              # Fix Node.js vulnerabilities
```

**🧪 Security Testing**
```python
# Include security tests in your contributions
def test_sql_injection_protection():
    """Verify SQL injection protection in user inputs."""
    malicious_input = "'; DROP TABLE users; --"
    result = process_user_input(malicious_input)
    assert "error" in result
    assert "invalid input" in result["message"]

def test_swedish_text_sanitization():
    """Ensure Swedish characters don't bypass input validation."""
    swedish_input = "åäö'; DROP TABLE användare; --"
    result = sanitize_swedish_input(swedish_input)
    assert is_safe_string(result)
```
