# Alice AI Assistant - Performance Budgets & Optimization Targets

## Overview

This document defines performance budgets, optimization targets, and monitoring guidelines for Alice AI Assistant to ensure production-ready performance during always-on voice operations. These budgets establish clear boundaries for resource usage and response times to maintain excellent user experience.

## Performance Budget Framework

### 1. CPU Usage Budgets

| Metric | Target | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Optimization Action |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Average CPU Usage** | < 20% | 30% | 50% | Scale resources, optimize algorithms |
| **Peak CPU Usage** | < 60% | 80% | 95% | Identify bottlenecks, implement throttling |
| **Voice Processing CPU** | < 40% | 60% | 80% | Optimize STT/TTS pipelines |
| **Background Tasks CPU** | < 10% | 20% | 30% | Defer non-critical operations |

**Justification**: Always-on systems require significant CPU headroom for burst processing during voice interactions while maintaining responsive background operations.

### 2. Memory Usage Budgets

| Metric | Target | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Optimization Action |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Baseline Memory** | < 512MB | 768MB | 1GB | Reduce model sizes, optimize caching |
| **Peak Memory Usage** | < 1GB | 1.5GB | 2GB | Implement memory pooling, garbage collection |
| **Memory Growth Rate** | < 5MB/hour | 10MB/hour | 20MB/hour | Fix memory leaks, optimize data structures |
| **Memory Leak Detection** | 0 leaks | 1 leak/hour | > 1 leak/hour | Immediate debugging and fixes |

**Justification**: Voice assistants must maintain consistent memory footprint during extended operation to prevent system degradation.

### 3. Voice Operation Performance Budgets

| Metric | Target | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | User Experience Impact |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Wake Word Detection** | < 100ms | 150ms | 250ms | Delayed responsiveness |
| **Speech-to-Text Latency** | < 300ms | 500ms | 1000ms | Perceived sluggishness |
| **Intent Processing** | < 200ms | 400ms | 800ms | Slow understanding |
| **Response Generation** | < 800ms | 1200ms | 2000ms | Frustrating delays |
| **Text-to-Speech** | < 200ms | 400ms | 600ms | Robotic interaction |
| **End-to-End Latency** | < 1.5s | 2.5s | 4s | Poor user experience |

**Justification**: Human conversation expects natural response timing. Delays beyond these thresholds break conversational flow.

### 4. System Resource Budgets

| Metric | Target | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Disk I/O Rate** | < 50MB/hour | 100MB/hour | 200MB/hour | Storage wear, performance |
| **Network Bandwidth** | < 10Mbps | 20Mbps | 50Mbps | API rate limits, costs |
| **File Descriptors** | < 100 | 200 | 500 | System resource exhaustion |
| **Thread Count** | < 50 | 100 | 200 | Context switching overhead |
| **Database Connections** | < 10 | 20 | 50 | Connection pool exhaustion |

### 5. Concurrent User Budgets

| User Count | CPU Budget | Memory Budget | Response Time SLA | Optimization Strategy |
|------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **1-5 users** | < 30% | < 768MB | < 1s | Single-instance optimization |
| **5-15 users** | < 50% | < 1.2GB | < 1.5s | Connection pooling, caching |
| **15-30 users** | < 70% | < 1.8GB | < 2s | Horizontal scaling preparation |
| **30+ users** | Scale out | Scale out | < 2s | Multi-instance deployment |
