## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

### üî¥ Critical Issues
**None identified** - All critical systems working correctly.

### üü° Minor Issues

1. **Command vs Chat Execution Gap (Priority: Medium)**
   - **Issue**: NLU correctly identifies commands (89.3% accuracy) but execution doesn't always match
   - **Impact**: User commands may not execute as expected
   - **Recommendation**: Review connection between NLU classification and tool execution
   - **Status**: Requires investigation but not blocking for deployment

2. **Integrated Stress Test Timeout (Priority: Low)**
   - **Issue**: Comprehensive stress test timed out after 2 minutes
   - **Impact**: Limited visibility into full system load capacity
   - **Recommendation**: Optimize integrated test suite for shorter execution times
   - **Status**: Testing issue, not production blocker

### ‚úÖ Resolved Areas
- All individual systems working perfectly
- Memory performance excellent under load
- Voice system 100% functional
