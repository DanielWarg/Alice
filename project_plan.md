## 🚦 Jarvis 2.0 — Incremental Build Plan

### F1: Connect HUD and Brain (Foundations)
- [x] Next.js PWA HUD scaffolded (`web/`, SAFE_BOOT default)
- [x] Backend FastAPI skeleton with WS hello and health (`server/app.py`)
- [ ] HUD WebSocket client: listen to `/ws/jarvis` and dispatch `hud_command`
- [ ] Prompt input → POST `/api/jarvis/command`
- [ ] HUD panels: "Intent Queue" and "Journal" (stream AI intents/lessons)
- [x] Health endpoint `/api/health` and basic logging

#### F1.1 Security Baseline
- [ ] Strict CORS, TLS-ready config, CSRF for REST
- [ ] WS auth (short-lived JWT), audience + expiry checks
- [ ] Tool call schema validation and parameter whitelisting
- [ ] Rate limiting and basic abuse detection

### F2: Memory Lite (RAG)
- [ ] SQLite tables: `events`, `memories(text/image)`, `lessons`, `tool_stats`
- [ ] Embeddings pipeline (text via Ollama nomic-embed-text)
- [ ] FAISS index for text; BM25 hybrid retrieval
- [ ] API: `/api/memory/upsert`, `/api/memory/retrieve`
- [ ] Prompt builder: top‑K memories + lessons included in system prompt

#### F2.1 Feedback Loop
- [ ] HUD feedback (👍/👎) → POST `/api/feedback`
- [ ] Update `memories.score` and `tool_stats`, boost successful patterns

### F3: Online Learning
- [ ] Bandit v1 for tool selection (ε‑greedy/Thompson); reward = success/utility
- [ ] Shadow simulation (simulate‑first) pre‑check for risky actions
- [ ] Safety governor thresholds and human‑confirm when low confidence

### F4: Perception (CV & Sensors)
- [ ] CV ingest: detect (RT‑DETR/YOLOv8), track (ByteTrack), CLIP embeddings for keyframes/objects
- [ ] Sensor ingest + feature store (aggregations, anomalies, tags)
- [ ] Visual & sensor memories into RAG retrieval

### F5: Offline Training (Policy)
- [ ] Replay buffer of sessions (plans, tool calls, outcomes, feedback)
- [ ] Nightly DPO/LoRA on controller (not the 20B model)
- [ ] Reward model v1 (classify good/bad outcomes)
- [ ] Distillation of 20B chains of thought into controller for faster inference

### F6: Packaging & Ops
- [ ] Electron/Tauri desktop packaging
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (lint, build, tests, deploy)
- [ ] Observability dashboards (tool success, latency, memory hit‑rate, autonomy ratio)

### Acceptance per Phase
- **F1**: HUD receives `hud_command` over WS; user input to REST; visible Intent/Journal panels
- **F2**: Retrieval improves answers; lessons show up; relevant context included in prompts
- **F3**: Tool success rate trends upward with bandit; risky actions blocked by simulate‑first
- **F4**: AI references visual/sensor context in plans; RAG returns recent observations
- **F5**: Controller decisions improve without calling 20B for every step
- **F6**: Desktop app available; CI/CD green; clear telemetry
